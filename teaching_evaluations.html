        <!-- Each comment wrapped in a blockquote -->
        <blockquote>The Professor was very helpful in terms of adaptability with how students are feeling in the course. Several Times, he checked in with the class about how we were feeling about the course material to make sure we were on the right track. Lastly, every class period he would build in review from previous weeks to make sure we are retaining the information.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>It was a great learning environment. I felt very comfortable sharing my thoughts and feelings & never was scared to put an answer out there or ask a question.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Matthew REALLY included his students when decided course expectations. He truly made me feel like he was setting us up for success.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Class was engaging and the teacher helped motivate me to want to be successful in the course by giving a good amount of positive reinforcement and that was very helpful after not doing so well in other online classes.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>This class has been one of the better ones I have taken in terms of the instructor desiring to give and receive feedback as well as structuring the class in a way where we could focus on learning content and not about keeping our grade up.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Matthew was a very well organized instructor. He kept every class similar and had a strict schedule on what we were doing in every class. All the students knew exactly what to except every class and it helped keep me less stressed in this course.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>The readings were pretty interesting, and the behavioral objectives were super helpful in knowing what to focus on! The lectures were engaging and I liked the group activities as they helped with application to real life principles.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Matthew told us exactly what we needed to be reading and provided outlining questions to guide our reading in a meaningful way.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Honestly there isn’t much room for improvement. This course was one of the best structured courses I’ve seen at KU. I am a junior and have gone here all 3 years and this was one of the most on top of things professor I have worked with.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>I like that I am engaged in the information being taught. There are so many classes I have taken at KU during my time, and have gained nothing from the course, but this one I have</blockquote>
            <blockquote>I really enjoyed taking this class. I think it was very informative and the format was great, I feel like I actually learned something from it and not just crammed to remember information.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>This is a side of ABSC I never knew about but wish I had sooner. I really enjoy javing guided notes & behavioral objectives for the readings. It helps me study much better</blockquote>
            <blockquote>I like that it's applicable to real life + that we get to read so many studies/see examples of how OBM is used. Also the small class is nice + less intimidating</blockquote>
            <blockquote>A great and flexible environment, made it a lot less stressful to be a student in the class.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>One of the best instructors I've had! Thank you for making this course so easy to be in it was enjoyable and I took a lot from it.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>The teaching is very comprehensive and you do a good job of thorougly explaining each concept for us to fully understand.</blockquote>
