<h1>Research Approach</h1>
<p>I have adopted two approaches to research. First, I believe research must “contribute [its] quota to the sum-total of human happiness; and it must appeal to every human being who is interested in increasing human efficiency and human happiness” (Hall et al., 1917, p. 6). Second, I embrace the view that research is a continuous and adaptive process and that “when you run onto something interesting, drop everything else and study it” (Skinner, 1956, p. 223). These two quotes highlight my research emphasis on studying topics that have social importance and adapting my research when interesting phenomena arise. At a broad level, through my research, I seek to improve employee performance and well-being through applied and use-inspired laboratory research.</p>

        This study evaluated how speech disfluencies affect perceived speaker effectiveness. Speeches with filler sounds and filler words at different rates of disfluencies (i.e., 0, 2, 5, and 12 per minute) were created and evaluated by a crowdsourcing service for survey-based research for the speaker's public speaking performance. Increased disfluencies, particularly filler sounds, significantly affected perceptions across most categories, notably at higher rates of filler sounds (i.e., 12 per minute). A low, but nonzero, rate of disfluencies (5 per minute) did not adversely affect perceived effectiveness. These findings suggest that although reducing filler sounds is crucial for optimizing perceived speaking effectiveness, a rate of five or fewer disfluencies per minute may be acceptable.

        This study evaluated the efficacy of (a) remote video‐based behavioral skills training (BST) with added speech outlines on teaching public speaking behaviors and (b) remote video‐based awareness training (AT) on speech‐disfluency rates. A multiple‐baseline design across speech behaviors was used to evaluate the training. Remote video‐based BST and AT were effective at teaching public speaking behaviors and reducing speech disfluencies, respectively, for both participants. In addition, performance generalized to increased audience size. Although expert ratings of perceived public speaking effectiveness improved following BST, the ratings did not improve and some worsened following AT. Both participants reported satisfaction with video‐based BST and AT. One participant reported greater comfort, confidence, overall ability, and less anxiety as a public speaker following BST. Both participants reported greater improvements in those categories following AT. Our results suggest that public speaking behaviors can be taught using remote video‐based BST and speech disfluencies can be reduced using remote video‐based AT.

Although training has long been studied by behavioral scientists, important considerations have sometimes been neglected from the perspective of instructional design if one wants training to be both efficient and effective. The most critical outcome for the design of any training system is to efficiently ensure that the graduates from a training sequence can perform to the standards of behavior expected of an expert while facing conditions that an expert would likely encounter.

        Behavioral safety is one of the most mature and efficacious applications of organizational behavior management in industrial workplaces. Built on the foundation of behavior analysis, behavioral safety attempts to prevent harm and reduce human suffering by targeting risk and intervening upon environmental factors related to safe behaviors. The current paper will (a) review the core components of a behavioral safety process, (b) highlight the extension of modern OBM methodologies (e.g., behavioral systems analysis) in behavioral safety, and (c) review best practices from world-class behavioral safety programs accredited by the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies (CCBS).

        Introduction: Using crew scheduling and injury incident data from a Fortune 500 manufacturing company, this study analyzed the effect of consecutive shifts and shifts near holidays on near misses and incidents. Methods: Logistic regressions were conducted with consecutive workdays, days near holidays, and time of shift as predictors of incident and near miss outcomes. Results: The logistic regression analysis indicated that working consecutive day shifts increases the probability of an incident occurring, with the fourth consecutive shift resulting in the most risk. The consecutive shift pattern did not replicate to employees working the night shift. However, the first and second shifts when transferring to a night schedule appear to have a greater chance of incident. Shifts near holidays did not have a significantly higher risk than other shifts. Practical application: The current research suggests that organizations can use similar analytic techniques to determine if shift scheduling might be related to increased risk and allocate resources to mitigate hazards during those peak probability shifts.

        This study evaluated the efficacy of remote video-based behavioral skills training (BST) on teaching public speaking behaviors to 4 participants. A multiple-baseline design across speech behaviors was used to evaluate the effects of the training. Remote video-based BST was effective at increasing public speaking behaviors for all participants. In addition, performance generalized to an increased audience size. An external expert in communications rated the participants as more effective public speakers following training. All participants reported satisfaction with the training and expressed greater comfort, confidence, overall ability, and less anxiety as a public speaker following training. We also measured potential collateral effects of teaching public speaking behaviors on speech disfluencies. Although remote video-based BST was effective for all participants, it did not produce a change in the rate of speech disfluencies. Our findings indicate that public speaking behaviors can be taught using a remote video-based BST package.

          <!-- Abstract text -->
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being utilized by organizations in selection decisions. However, research has fallen behind the practice, and one area in need of investigation is how applicants' perceptions of justice are formed
        in this increased involvement of AI in the hiring process. Accordingly, two studies were conducted to investigate the effects of using AI in selection on justice perceptions. Findings indicated that AI‐based interviewing was generally viewed
        as less procedurally and interactionally just than traditional human‐based interviewing. Additionally, the effect of interview type on different applicant reaction outcomes was mediated by justice dimensions, particularly two‐way
      communication. Findings may help organizations regarding how best to utilize AI in selection in order to attract and retain top talent.

        This chapter presents an overview of how organizational behavior management has been used to improve the well-being of both organizations and their employees. First, an overview of the profession is discussed, highlighting its historical development from training initiatives to a discipline that examines employee performance (both individually and collectively), work processes, and the organizational structure to discover the interventions that create value across contexts and considerations. Second, the field's applicable conceptual and basic work is reviewed, along with a discussion of how this work is adapted for practical application. Finally, guidance on the skills and knowledge necessary for entering the profession is provided.

        For the past 50 years, organizational behavior management has used behavior analysis to analyze and solve organizational challenges managing the performance of its people. Numerous behavioral assessment techniques and real-world interventions have been developed and empirically tested to understand and manage the complexity of organizational contingencies and metacontingencies. Similarly, other areas of applied behavior analysis have demonstrated empirical impact delivering behavior analytic services to clients in human services, education, and beyond. Applied behavior analysis as a service industry faces the same organizational challenges that organizational behavior management addresses. This chapter introduces and describes how organizational behavior management can enable and enhance the delivery of behavior analytic services by managing the contingencies operating on the service providers.

        Pyramidal training involves a staff training approach that includes three tiers of individuals. Tier one includes a trainer with expertise and knowledge about effective training procedures. This expert may include someone internal (e.g., supervisor and training director) or external (e.g., behavioral consultant and experimenter) to an organization. Tier-one trainers prepare a subset of staff to serve as tier-two trainers. Individuals who serve as tier-two trainers are then responsible for implementing the practices taught by the expert trainer to train tier-three employees (e.g., direct care/human service staff, teachers, and paraeducators). Organizations adopting this approach can experience numerous benefits, ultimately enhancing service quality and staff performance to support individuals with autism. Nearly five decades of published research supports this model for training human service employees. This chapter highlights the relevant research supporting pyramidal staff training, discusses the benefits, and describes potential considerations—training practices, resources, conducting quality checks, and programming for sustainability—for adopting this training model.

        Behavioral safety is one of the most mature and efficacious applications of organizational behavior management in industrial workplaces. Built on the foundation of behavior analysis, behavioral safety attempts to prevent harm and reduce human suffering by targeting risk and intervening upon environmental factors related to safe behaviors. The current paper will (a) review the core components of a behavioral safety process, (b) highlight the extension of modern OBM methodologies (e.g., behavioral systems analysis) in behavioral safety, and (c) review best practices from world-class behavioral safety programs accredited by the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies (CCBS).

        Human service staff are often responsible for implementing a variety of behavioral technologies and require training to implement them with high accuracy. Video modeling is an attractive approach to training staff and an increasing number of researchers have evaluated the usefulness of such an approach. To this end, this chapter addresses leveraging video modeling to train human service staff. To do so, we briefly reviewed video modeling and its related benefits, discussed common applications of video modeling in the extent literature, explored variations of video modeling, and discussed other considerations for adopting video modeling as a training approach. We attempted to frame our discussion within the context of relevant examples from the research literature and recommended practice guidelines to increase the likelihood of successful adoption of video modeling.
